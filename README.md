## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js
* npm
* MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas
* Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sammed1202/quickfix_auto.git
```

```bash
cd quickfix_auto
```

### 2. Setup the Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `server` directory and add the required environment variables used by the application.

Example:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Add any other environment variables required by your configuration, such as email credentials.

Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Start the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on the local development server.

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Do not commit sensitive credentials to GitHub.

The following types of values should be stored in environment variables:

* MongoDB connection string
* JWT secret
* Email credentials
* API keys
* Other private configuration values

## 📂 Backend Architecture

The backend is organized into separate layers:

```text
server/
├── config/
├── controller/
├── middleware/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── uploads/
├── bookingScheduler.js
└── index.js
```

### Controllers

Controllers handle application logic for areas such as:

* Users
* Admin
* Contacts
* Shop services

### Models

MongoDB/Mongoose models include areas such as:

* Users
* Bookings
* Notifications
* Shop services
* Contacts
* Spam users

### Routes

API routes are separated from controller logic to keep the backend organized and maintainable.

## 🎯 Project Goals

QuickFix Auto was developed to demonstrate how a real-world service platform can be built using the MERN stack.

The project focuses on:

* Full-stack web development
* REST API development
* Authentication and authorization
* Database integration
